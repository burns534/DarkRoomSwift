# DarkRoomSwift

This is a small 2D game I began. It uses SpriteKit and spawns the player on a flat plane. The player will have a small area of the map to explore, but will be surrounded by a moat of water and must progress through the game to craft a boat to cross the water and explore more. The app is incomplete and I'm still not sure where I want to go with it. It is intended to have a clicker style economy based on soybeans which the player exchanges for other goods for crafting, etc.
